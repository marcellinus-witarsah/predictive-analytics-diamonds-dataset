# Predictive Analytics on Diamonds Dataset
The steps involved are:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Preparation/ Preprocessing
3. Modelling
4. Evaluation
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA will include **Data loading**, **Variable Description**, **Handle Missing Values and Outliers**, **Univariate Analysis**, and **Multivariate Analysis**.
## Data Preparation/ Preprocessing
## Modelling
Experimenting on Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Boosting Algorithm for modelling.
## Evaluation
Evaluate model using Mean Squared Error, and Root Mean Squared Error.
